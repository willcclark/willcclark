- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @willcclark. I am a [high school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) student in the [United States](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... Well, everything! I am just an all-round computer nerd!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [JavaScript](https://nodejs.org/en/), using [Microsoft's Beginner Series to: JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhW0NCG7M536uHGOtJ95Ut2)
- :nerd_face: Used [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) for a while - Recently tried [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) - again. Well, I guess I just love [Linux](https://opensource.com/resources/linux). Windows can be a bit of a royal pain to deal with.
